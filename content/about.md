I'm Amritpal Singh, a soon-to-be to be Computer Science student.
My interests vary from Computers to Photography, Reading,
Cooking and basically anything that interests me.

In terms of the technical interests, I love working closesly with systems.
I'm quite experienced in C and currently I'm trying to increase my repertoire
with C++. Most of my notable projects are pinned on my github profile
and listed on the [Projects]({{< ref "/portfolio" >}} "Portfolio") page.
