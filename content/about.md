I'm Amritpal Singh, a soon-to-be Computer Science student.
My interests vary from Computers to Photography, Reading,
Cooking, and anything that interests me.

I'm a newbie programmer and I have a taste for learning new things about
computer systems and programming techniques.

In terms of technical interests, I love working closely with systems.
I'm quite experienced in C and currently, I'm trying to add C++ to 
my repertoire as of early-2023. I still have not found my niche in the 
systems industry and that is why I always try to dip my toes in the 
various sub-fields. Most of my notable projects are pinned on my 
GitHub profile and listed on the [Projects]({{< ref "/portfolio" >}} "Portfolio") page.
