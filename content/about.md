I'm Amrit, I consider myself a student of science.
My interests vary from Computers to Photography, Reading,
Cooking, and anything that interests me.

I'm a programmer and I have a taste for learning new things about
computer systems and programming techniques.

In terms of technical interests, I love working closely with systems.
Most of my notable projects are listed on the [Projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}} "Projects") page.
