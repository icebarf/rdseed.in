I'm Amrit, a computer science student and a hobbyist programmmer.
My interests vary from Computers to Photography, Reading, and Learning
new languages.

I love working closely with systems, with experience in C, C++, Python, and x86_64.
I don't have something that I particularly love, so I try to involve myself in various projects.
Most of my notable projects are pinned on my 
GitHub profile and listed on the [Projects]({{< ref "/portfolio" >}} "Portfolio") page.
