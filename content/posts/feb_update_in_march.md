Hello there, It's been a while since I updated my blog.
Last week, I was working on refactoring [Perfmode](https://github.com/icebarf/perfmode),
which has gone pretty nicely. I've added a couple of features to it and
somewhat improved the overall quality of the code.
Moving on, I've now begun reading [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). It seems like a good book for someone like me.
Iâ€™ve read the first 3 chapters, containing the boilerplate information for the actual project.
The chapters introduce the PPM Image format and define a 3d-vector type.
So far it is going pretty nicely. As I read more, I'll update this post with more information.

See ya!
