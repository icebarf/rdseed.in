I have been wondering why I suck at what I do, why I'm the least skilled among my skilled peers.
After pondering on it for a while, I have come to realise - I simply do not do what I want, 
instead I chase after what I think I want which will lead me to become more skilled.

But I realise that now as I see at my past self, who got me to the point where I am today, by doing what I wanted.
In the process of getting here, I think I forgot what I was doing. But now that I know, It is imperative that I go 
back to the old way of learning, because that is the only possible way in which I retain most of the information.
