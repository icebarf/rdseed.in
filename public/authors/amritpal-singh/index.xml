      <description>Hello there, It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I updated my blog. Last week, I was working on refactoring Perfmode, which has gone pretty nicely. I&amp;rsquo;ve added a couple of features to it and somewhat improved the overall quality of the code. Moving on, I&amp;rsquo;ve now begun reading Ray Tracing in One Weekend. It seems like a good book for someone like me. Iâ€™ve read the first 3 chapters, containing the boilerplate information for the actual project.</description>

      <description>I have been wondering why I suck at what I do, why I&amp;rsquo;m the least skilled among my skilled peers. After pondering on it for a while, I have come to realise - I simply do not do what I want, instead I chase after what I think I want which will lead me to become more skilled.
But I realise that now as I see at my past self, who got me to the point where I am today, by doing what I wanted.</description>
