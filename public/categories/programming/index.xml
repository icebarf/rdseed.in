      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a small hobby project/program of mine. It implements image rotation by some angle (in degrees). I chose the bitmap format to write back the image that was rotated, the input image is also expected to be a bitmap image.
Anyhow, while parsing I realised that the bitmap file header begins with a 2 byte type number that identifies the BMP and DIB header. It is commonly 0x424d (BM in ascii, 0x4d42 in little endian, how it shall appear on my machine and probably yours as well.</description>
