      <description>I have been wondering why I suck at what I do, why I&amp;rsquo;m the least skilled among my skilled peers. After pondering on it for a while, I have come to realise - I simply do not do what I want, instead I chase after what I think I want which will lead me to become more skilled.
But I realise that now as I see at my past self, who got me to the point where I am today, by doing what I wanted.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m a humongous bro. Asking questions and seems like I know more than I do because, I&amp;rsquo;m good at calculating stuff. Basically, what people would take as a sign of knowledge is actually putting together the obvious.
