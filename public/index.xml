      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Amrit, I consider myself a student of science. My interests vary from Computers to Photography, Reading, Cooking, and anything that interests me.
I&amp;rsquo;m a programmer and I have a taste for learning new things about computer systems and programming techniques.
In terms of technical interests, I love working closely with systems. Most of my notable projects are listed on the Projects page.</description>
